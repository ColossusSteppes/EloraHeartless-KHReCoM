Edits a few Heartless colors to how I like them. Most of them keep their original PS2 colors, but some now have their Final Mix colors, and some are edited slightly. Enemy Cards are unaffected. 

## Changed Heartless

- Bandit (Uses Final Mix Colors)
- Wight Knight (Uses Final Mix Colors)
- Search Ghost (Uses Final Mix Colors in both Monstro and Halloween Town)
- Sea Neon (Changes the tentacle color to yellow and red like the Final Mix version)
- Air Pirate (Changes the bandana to red and white like the Final Mix version)
